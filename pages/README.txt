The pages account allows easier management off all pages/urls associated with the site. 

Url path is pulled from this app to the django project upon deployment. 

Inital pages added to this app are Home and About. 

Random page will create a random index number (maximun number can be the length of the
total images stored) to show a random image. This is done with every refresh.
